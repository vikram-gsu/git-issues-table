# Take home test

## Tools Used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used Semantic-ui-react for the following:

1. Grid for organizing the space
2. Table for showing the content
3. Search for making the table searchable

I used Typescript to make the code typed, make it more readable and understandable.

I used Jest as the test runner and Enzyme for testing react components(Unit and snapshot testing)

## Running

1. To deploy the application
